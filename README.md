# Sensor Simulator Application

The sensor simulator application reads from the simulation output topic of the gridappsd message bus, creates random
noise on magnitued and angle points, and then writes those new points to a gridappsd message bus.

Further documentation can be found at https://gridappsd-sensor-simulator.readthedocs.io/ or https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/.
