## `simulation_measurements_13.json` and `simulation_measurements_header_13.json`
Copied from the [pyvvo repository](https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/pyvvo)
at commit `028a8173e224054fbe5a2e9cea44ea2eaa54707f`. These files were
created by running a simulation with the IEEE 13 bus system, and simply
dumping the platform output measurement message and header to file.
